# Twitter Analysis GOI
The main motive behind this project was to take advantage of the power of Social Media to understand how Official Indian Government handles function on twitter. By analysing Twitter data we can easily understand which GOI handles focus on which core issues and policies.
Analysis was performed on Twitter data of 115 official Government Handles on about 350,000 tweets using Python. The Twitter API was used to collect all the data.
